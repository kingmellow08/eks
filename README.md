#Kubernetes Cluster with AWS EKS and Terraform
Overview
This project sets up a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and automates the infrastructure provisioning using Terraform. The workflow is automated with GitHub Actions, facilitating continuous integration and deployment processes.

Features
Kubernetes Cluster: Utilizes AWS EKS for a managed Kubernetes service.
Infrastructure as Code: Employs Terraform for automating infrastructure setup.
CI/CD: Integrates GitHub Actions for automating workflows.
Prerequisites
AWS Account
Terraform installed locally
Configured AWS CLI
GitHub Account
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone [your-repository-link]
cd [repository-name]
Initialize Terraform:

Navigate to the Terraform directory and initialize it:
cd terraform
terraform init

cd terraform
terraform init


Creating a README.md for your GitHub repository that details your Kubernetes cluster setup with AWS EKS, automated workflow using GitHub Actions, and infrastructure automation using Terraform can be quite straightforward. Here's a template you can use and modify according to your specific project details:

GitHub Actions Workflow
The .github/workflows directory contains the GitHub Actions workflow files.
Current setup does not automate the on/push event. Manual triggering is required for workflow execution.
Manual Steps
Since the on/push event in GitHub Actions is not automated, follow these steps for manual deployment:

Commit and Push Changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main

Manually Trigger Workflow:

Navigate to the 'Actions' tab in your GitHub repository and manually trigger the workflow.
